Little assorted scripts for checking my work in Linear Algebra

Currently calculates determinants, products, inverses of martices solves square linear systems of equations with one or no (via assertationerror) solutions, performes LU decomposition, and can somewhat calculate the dominant eigenvalue and accompanying eigenvector of a matrix using power methods. The eigenvalues are a bit finicky, particularly with diagonal matrices, so up next are fixes to that and a more comprehensive calculator for eigenvalues.
